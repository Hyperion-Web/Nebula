# Compositions

Compositions are special molecular components that implement intrinsic layout design. They are a cross between layouts (they are called this in Andy and Heydon's book Every Layout) and molecules as they always consume lower level components. 

The distinction I am making here is that layouts in the `layouts` folder are really consumer driven rather than abstract, primitive layouts like these are.

Once all of the primitives are implemented I will be hesitant to add to this folder.
