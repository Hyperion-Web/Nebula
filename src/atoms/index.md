# Atoms 

## What are atoms in Nebula?

Atoms are the smallest units of a design. In essence, they are not much larger than the html primitives you normally use. These exist as `.vue` components to add enhanced features and instill design logic from the bottom up.

## Is the code I am writing an atom? 

1. is your intent for the component to be nested inside of more complicated components?
2. can you break your component down into sub-components?
